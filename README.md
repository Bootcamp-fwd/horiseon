## 📦 Features

|    | Feature             | Description                                                                                                                               |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**    | The codebase follows a simple HTML and CSS architecture, where different components of the webpage are defined separately and combined to form the final output. The use of semantic HTML tags and CSS classes helps in maintaining code structure and readability.       |               |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**    | The project doesn't have any external dependencies. It relies solely on HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easy to work with.                                                                     |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into separate components in individual files, enhancing readability and reusability. CSS classes are also well-structured, further improving code reusability.            |
| 🧪 | **Testing**         | The codebase doesn't include any automated testing.
| ⚡️ | **Performance**     | Given that the project mainly consists of static HTML and CSS files, performance should be optimal. However, it's worth considering improvements like code minification, image optimization, and caching for better performance. |
| 🔐 | **Security**        | As a static website, there are no significant security measures implemented. However, appropriate security headers and best practices, such as using HTTPS and protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, should be considered when deploying the website.   |
| 🔀 | **Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, providing robust history tracking, collaboration capabilities, and the ability to revert changes easily if needed.                                                          |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**    | The codebase doesn't integrate with any external systems or services. However, being a static website, it can be easily published on platforms like GitHub Pages or served through a web server.                    |
| 📶 | **Scalability**     | The codebase is not specifically optimized for scalability. However, as a static website, it can handle a large number of users without significant performance impact. Scaling can be achieved by leveraging Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to distribute files globally and caching static assets to reduce server load.                  |
